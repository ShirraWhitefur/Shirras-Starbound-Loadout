		"Fel are divided into three classes, being sli, malenri, and shalrae, according to the size of his mronal. Fela also, according to the depth of her mroli, are either naeri, moleri, or elheri.

There are thus three equal unions between persons of corresponding dimensions, and there are six unequal unions, when the dimensions do not match up, or nine in all.",

		"In these unequal unions, when the fel exceeds the fela in point of size, his union with a fela who is immediately next to him in size is called high union, and is of two kinds; while his union with the fela most remote from him in size is called the highest union, and is of one kind only.",

		"On the other hand when the fela exceeds the fel in point of size, her union with a fel immediately next to her in size is called low union, and is of two kinds; while her union with a fel most remote from her in size is called the lowest union, and is of one kind only.",
		
		"All these things apply equally to the felhru.",


		"Scholars learned in the workings of the mind are of the opinion that shigri is of four kinds, those being:

(1) Shigri resulting from the constant and continual performance and habit, as for instance the shigri of lufhie, the shigri of the hunt, the shigri of drinking, the shigri of gambling, and so on.",

		"(2) Shigri which is felt for things to which we are not habituated, and which proceeds entirely from ideas, is called shigri resulting from imagination, as for instance, that shigri which some felin feel for mrilifhie, and that which is felt by all for such things as a liah, mriliari, and so on.",

		"(3) The shigri which is mutual on both sides, and proved to be true, when each looks upon the other as their very own, such is called shigri resulting from belief by the learned.

(4) The shigri resulting from the perception of eternal objects is quite evident and well-known to the world, because the erdinfi which it affords is superior to the erdinfi of the other kinds of shigri, which exists only for its sake.",


		"By engaging in lufhie with felin huprhae obtain their erdinfi, as well as their maintenance. Now when a huprhae takes up with a felin from shigri, the action is natural; but when they resorts to them for the purpose of getting money, their action is artificial.",

		"Even in the latter case, however, they should conduct themself as if their shigri were indeed natural, because felin repose their confidence on those who apparently hold shigri for them.

In making known their shigri to the felin they should show an entire freedom from avarice, and for the sake of their future credit they should abstain from acquiring money from them by unlawful means.",

		"A huprhae, well dressed and wearing the accessories of their trade, should roam their house as they please but not leave as a client could arrive any time."
